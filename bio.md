My biggest hobbies used to be birding and bird photography before I had a baby.  Now I spend all my spare time with my lovely daughter.  I maintain the photography hobby, but now I just take pictures of my daughter.

#Programming Background
My favorite project involved creating a hangman GUI.
I also really enjoyed programming in an assembly language because I like tracing the data in the registers.
